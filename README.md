# **2D Isometric Boilerplate**
2D Isometric Boilerplate is a Unity starter project that uses the code from [Yugu Library](https://github.com/citrusunshiu/yugu-library) to allow users to easily create 2D turn-based and real-time isometric games.

There are 3 main parts of this project:

**Yugu Library** contains the code for creating the client-side application.

### Coming Soon
**[Yugu Editor](https://github.com/citrusunshiu/yugu-editor)** is an Electron application for creating, editing and managing the JSON files and related assets used by a Yugu Library project.

**[GFW Server](https://github.com/citrusunshiu/gfw-server)** is a .NET Core server-side application that client-side applications can connect to, allowing for multiplayer and persistent game worlds.

## **Preface**
**This project is a work in progress; all intended features for the first release have not been implemented yet.** The full list of currently planned features can be found at [Scope, Missing Features & Design Documents](https://github.com/citrusunshiu/2d-isometric-boilerplate/wiki/Scope,-Missing-Features-&-Design-Documents).
